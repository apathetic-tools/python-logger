### Asking Questions and Waiting for Responses

- **When asking a question**: If you ask the user a question (e.g., "Should I...?", "Would you like me to...?", "Do you want...?"), you **must pause and wait for their response** before proceeding with any actions related to that question.

- **Do NOT proceed automatically**: After asking a question, do not assume the answer and proceed with the suggested action. Wait for explicit confirmation or direction from the user.

- **Exception**: If the user's query is a direct instruction (e.g., "add a function that...", "fix the bug in..."), you should proceed with the implementation without asking for confirmation, as the instruction itself is the confirmation.

- **Clarifying questions**: When you need clarification to understand the user's request, ask the question and wait for the response before continuing.

### Handling Developer Questions

- **When the developer asks a question**: If the developer asks ANY question (including analytical questions like "do we still need X?", "would it be safe to Y?", "can we simplify Z?"), you **must**:
  1. Provide a complete answer with recommendations
  2. Ask what to do and **stop** - do not implement changes
  3. Wait for their response before proceeding with any implementation

- **What counts as a question**: Any query ending with "?", or phrases like "do we need", "should we", "can we", "would it be safe", "is it possible", etc. Even if the question seems to imply action, treat it as a question first.

- **Exploratory work allowed**: You may perform exploratory findings (reading code, searching the codebase, analyzing patterns) to answer the question, but **do not modify core project code** to implement changes.

- **After answering**: Once you've provided the answer and recommendations, explicitly ask "Should I proceed with implementing this?" or "Would you like me to make these changes?" and wait for confirmation. Only proceed after explicit confirmation.
