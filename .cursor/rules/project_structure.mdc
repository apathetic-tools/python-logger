### Important Files
- `dist/apathetic_logging.py` is **generated** - never edit directly
- Generate it using `poetry run poe build:script`
- `dist/` contains build outputs - do not edit

### Project Structure
- `src/package_name/` - Main source code (replace `package_name` with actual package name)
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `dev/` - Development scripts

### Test Directory Structure
- **`__init__.py` files in tests**: Only `tests/` and `tests/utils/` should have `__init__.py` files
- **Do NOT add `__init__.py`** to test subdirectories (e.g., `tests/0_tooling/`, `tests/3_independant/`, `tests/5_core/`, `tests/9_integration/`, `tests/10_app_integration/`)
- Test subdirectories are not Python packages and should not be treated as such by type checkers
