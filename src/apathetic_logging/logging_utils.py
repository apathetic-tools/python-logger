    This class contains utility functions that operate directly on or replace
    standard library `logging.*` utilities and functions. These helpers extend
    or wrap the built-in logging module functionality to provide enhanced
    capabilities or safer alternatives.

    When mixed into apathetic_logging, it provides utility functions that
    interact with Python's standard logging module.
